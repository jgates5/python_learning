#api_data = '5'
#greeting = 'Hi there'
#greeting = 'Hithere' -> now is 100% alpanumeric
#print(api_data.isalpha()) #is the 5 a set of alphanumeric characters or not? false
#print(greeting.isalpha()) #the space between 'hi there' is not alplanumeric. the whole '' has to be 100% to be alpanumeric.  #is hi set of alphanumeric characters or not? true

#use these 2 below often...
#print(api_data.isnumeric()) #5 is a number
#print(greeting.isnumeric() #)hi there is not a number
